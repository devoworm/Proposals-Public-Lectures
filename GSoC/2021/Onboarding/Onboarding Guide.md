## More Details on Specific Projects

### Project 3.1 - Upgrading Devolearn
This project revolves mainly around devolearn, a PyPI package that aims to make deep-learning models more accessible for research in developmental biology. 

__What can I do before GSoC?__  
You can start out by reading about the _C. elegans_ embryo, and then move on to either help us in improving our current models or add new ones. You can also help us solve some of the Github issues (if any) on the corresponding project boards. Please keep the mentors updated with your progress!

#### Skills:
PyTorch  
Numpy/Pandas   
openCV/imageio/FFMPEG tools  
Proficiency in writing scalable and modular code  

### Project 3.2 - Digital Bacillaria
You will be improving upon the Digital _Bacillaria_ project [link](https://github.com/devoworm/Digital-Bacillaria), which was started in the Summer of 2019. This year our main aim is to enhance the existing deep learning model. For the sake of uniformity, you might have to move the model from Tensorflow to PyTorch at first. You will be involved in pre-processing and analyzing microscopy videos from our database of _Bacillaria_ phenotype and movement.   

__What can I do before GSoC?__   
You can ask one of the mentors to direct you to the data source and you can start working on it. Please feel free to raise questions/discussions regarding your approach to the problem. Check out some of our community references for a better ideas of how your project might fit into the organization.

#### Skills/requirements 
PyTorch/Tensorflow (PyTorch will be preferred because all our other models are on that framework already)
Wrangling with video data 
Building a simple GUI on top of the model to run it on local systems (on Linux/windows/macOS)
General knowledge about Diatoms

### Project 3.3 - Digital Microsphere 
This project will build upon the specialized microscopy techniques to develop a shell composed of projected microscopy images, arranged to represent the full external surface of a sphere. This will allow us to create an atlas of the embryo’s outer surface, which in some species (e.g. Axolotl) enables us to have a novel perspective on neural development. 
You will build a computational tool to visualize these 4D data. 

__What can I do before GSoC?__ 
Build basic prototypes for this project and discuss about them with the mentors, then read these papers:

Gordon, R. (2009). [Google Embryo for Building Quantitative Understanding of an Embryo As It Builds Itself. II. Progress Toward an Embryo Surface Microscope](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1162/BIOT_a_00010). _Biological Theory_, 4, 396–412.

Crawford-Young, S., Dittapongpitch, S., Gordon, R., and Harrington, K. (2018). [Acquisition and reconstruction of 4D surfaces of axolotl embryos with the flipping stage robotic microscope](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0303264718302995). _Biosystems_, 173, 214-220.

#### Skills/requirements
Handling higher dimensional microscopy data (preferably also creating an API to load them as tensors for computation on the GPU)  
Building an intuitive GUI (or a web interface)   
Feature extraction (canny edges/thresholding/denoising)  

### General FAQ
__Can I send my proposal to the mentors for review?__
Yes, we’ll be happy to review it. But it might take a while depending on our schedules. 

__I am a beginner to developmental biology, where should I start?__ 

Check out these resources:  
[WormBook](http://www.wormbook.org/)   
[EPIC Dataset](https://epic.gs.washington.edu/)  
[Worm Atlas](https://www.wormatlas.org/embryo/introduction/EIntroframeset.html)  

__I am a beginner, how do I get started?__
Just ping one of the mentors, and we’ll help you get started.   

__Will my PRs/contributions count?__  
Yes, but it will depend on the type of PRs made. We will prioritize skills and experience over the number of PRs made.  

__Can I work on these projects even if I don’t get into GSoC?__ 
Of course, we’ll be happy to help.
