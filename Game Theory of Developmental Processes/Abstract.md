Developmental processes are dynamic and complex, and can be viewed from the perspective of interacting agents. We will provide a means to understand developmental agency at multiple organizational scales through the notion of ontogenetic agency, which will in turn enable an approach called developmental game theory. We will begin by reviewing the notion of an ontogenetic agent and how this construct relates to the formation of strategies. In short, ontogenetic agents taking the form of cells, morphogens, gene products, engage in a developmental process and produce coherent states. The interactions between these states (in the forms of competition or cooperation) can be characterized in a game model. While these strategies rely upon natural features such as developmental constraints and trade-offs rather than requiring a conventional decision-making apparatus, it does not preclude ontogenetic agents from engaging in autonomous and collective behaviors. A series of game-theoretic models suited to select problems in development will then be reviewed. These include different classes of game used to model different aspects of development: 0-player, single-player, n-player, and combinatorial. We will then discuss the broader dynamics of these games, such as equilibria, computational complexity, and evolutionary games. In addition to toy examples, these models will then be extended to systems, evolutionary equilibria, and homeostatic/allostatic regulation. In conclusion, we will consider how developmental game theory models provide a means to better understand the phenomena of cellular and biological decision-making.
