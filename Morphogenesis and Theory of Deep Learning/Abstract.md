## Morphogenetic Patterns and the Theory of Deep Learning  

Among the many recent advances in deep learning (DL) , one set of applications stands out: Generative Adversarial Networks [1] (GANs), a framework which uses existing data to generate new lifelike data [2]. Our goal is to propose a model of morphogenesis derived from the theory and mechanism behind deep neural networks. Relying upon the principle of computational equivalence [3], we can potentially uncover the universal elements of self-organization in a morphogenetic system[4]. Attempts at this using tools such as Cellular Automata (CAs) have yielded a means to generate patterns [5] but largely in a qualitative fashion. Connecting Neural Networks (NNs) to pattern-generating cellular automata [6] allows us to identify patterns that are generated. Yet there is much potential for us to exploit deep generative networks in the service of understanding how these patterns are formed and self-organize in a wide range of naturalistic contexts.  [7-10]

To see how deep learning architectures might make advances upon this, we will focus on three aspects of the theory behind deep learning networks: feature discovery, network depth, and network homogeneity. In a GAN, feature discovery proceeds in part through an adversarial approach. This allows for greater recognition ability as opposed to random or irrelevant images. Aside from features, NNs provide us with both circuits (network subgraphs that serve as a set of solutions) and universality (features and circuits that generalize across different systems and contexts) [11]. The GAN framework also uses deep neural networks, and so unlike CAs and standard NNs can exploit many layers of processing, specifying the generation and recognition of classes of specific features within a complex pattern. The depth of a DL allows for so-called cheap learning [12], which can be analogized to mechanisms of facilitated variation [13] and biological adaptation more generally. Finally, future DL models may allow for network heterogeneity, which has been identified as a factor in making artificial networks more like intelligent biological systems [14]. In conclusion, we will consider how DLs might be incorporated into embodied agents (morphogenetic agents) [15] that couple pattern generation with perception.
